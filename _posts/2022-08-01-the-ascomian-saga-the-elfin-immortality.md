       If elves are anything, they are bystanders of the wild purity of existence. They were there, in the center of all things, watching and assisting as a demagogic agency the birth and the fall of the human empire. Their abandon seems an annihilation, a sundering, a fall from a greater splendor. Their walking with humans on this earthly plane is bitter to them, and they are sufficiently alienated from the human world that perhaps they care not what they do to them. Indeed, they prey upon humans or adorn them with flowers and accommodate fiendish pleasures upon them in turn without distinction. They are naturally amoral. The fall of the elves is like the fall of an ancient order, from a purely poetic dimension of existence to a dry prosaic world. Among humans they suffer the isolation of the voiceless and the persecuted.”

Since the beginning of the Dream there where only beasts roaming around the lands. Among them the Elves stood out: highly intelligent and physically portentous. Elves could not die a natural or accidental death. Although some elves wielded terrible secrets from unknown origins, able to steal immortality, they lived a peaceful existence until the birth of the Pale Sun and its Oxidation: a mysterious phenomenon formally known by the Elves as the “First Oxidative Requiem” or “Elfin Oxidation”, called also “First Event” or “First Oxidation” by the human inhabitants of Ascom.
Immortality implied a lifestyle dedicated to knowledge. A considerable number of Elfin individuals achieved a level of knowledge envied by the most illustrious human sorcerers, known as necornauts. 
Even if immortal, Elfin body and mind were vulnerable to deterioration. Diseases, wounds and injuries would leave indelible scars. Spell, curses and mind-tricks would sometimes drove their minds into madness. 
Injuries caused atrocious pain, starvation led to a horrendous shriveling of the body, drowning meant falling asleep at the bottom of the river. Conquering emotions like love and pain, was possible, but useless, since life was eternal and memories forgettable. 
An amoral life was a buoyant life, yet saturnine and gaolish.
