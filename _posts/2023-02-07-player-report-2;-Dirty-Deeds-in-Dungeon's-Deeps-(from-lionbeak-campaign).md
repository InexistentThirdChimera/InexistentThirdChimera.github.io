On 29th of Fireseek 592 CY the party (Tabudai, Tarlandur, Reijo, May, Elmo and Klibo) wakes up after spending one night inside a shack in the courtyard of the fort. We decide to explore the only (apparently) investigatable building of the Fort: the main hut. We are welcomed with the vision of a big saloon furnished with rotten tables, broken chairs and nothing else, except for a small staircase in the corner, which steps lead to the lower floor. Some smaller footprints of humanoid physiognomy suggest recent pedestrian traffic covering a short stretch of corridor in the lower area.   

The group descends into the darkness. The dungeon seems to host various animals that have made their nests inside different rooms. Giant bees were immediately instigated by our curiosity, but other creatures where nowhere to see, we just hear their shrieking. 
Further on, the group decides to open a door behind which two halflings, suspicious and frightened, were spending their time. Tarlandur decides to approach the two half-men by immediately exposing their numerical disadvantage with a calm and regretful tone. Than Tabudai asked the half-men what their business is and what are they doing inside the dungeon, and as expected, the two half-men kept their business to themselves, finally inviting us to leave the place immediately. 

As they prepared to escort us out, Tarlandur quickly stabbed a half-man in the throat, using his hidden knife. Simultaneously, Reijo fired a dart, aiming to the leg of the other halfling, with no intent of killing. The two shin-lickers died on the spot <a name="nf1"><sup>[[1]](#fn1)</sup><a>. The aggressors had not planned the attack. Were this actions just a barbaric display of power? Also: the DM observed that Tarlandur’s and Reijo’s alignment shifted to Chaotic Evil. A spiral of death and violence seems to have begun with this act. We’ll soon see why. Tabudai and Reijo were partially shocked by this event. 

The party leaves the cadavers there and almost thoughtlessly proceeds to open the next door: ten orcish eyes penetrated our courageous intents, but Tabudai with his timing and luck cast Sleep, a powerful witchcraft, as our experience suggests. All five orcs fall to the ground, asleep and vulnerable.

Tarlandur is assigned the game of the prisoner's dilemma: the extrapolation of information with torture <a name="nf2"><sup>[[2]](#fn2)</sup><a>. All orcs were killed, except two. Two weak orcs were left alive. Once wakened up Tarlandur talked with both. After a while the second orc unintentionally confirmed the existence of a venom factory in the surroundings, as expected by the party. Contrary to the second: the first did not cooperate, in addition he provoked the torturer with sexual sledges, and was killed by the Insulted-One with an ironic stab in the a**. The second orc was forced to watch the execution. 

The tension in the room was palpable, but it eventually faded away when the "thirsty-for-information" party decided to surrender to the orc's terms. He would reveal us the location of a secret passage to the factory if we let him free. We freed the ogre into the swamp, who finally revealed us the path to reach a secret door inside the dungeon. 

We reached Thorham and asked the locals for shelter. We are offered a barn as accommodation, we accepted. The party will find comfort in that barn for the next few weeks. The gaming session ends.

Was that a reliable information? Was freeing an outlaw orc a smart decision <a name="nf3"><sup>[[3]](#fn3)</sup><a> ? Have we commit and old-school mass murder? Are we in danger now?

<a name="fn1">[[1]](#nf1)</a> Unlike our traditional and careful method of exploration, this time we opted for a straightforward approach. After encountering the giant bees, we turned our attention to the footprints that were leading somewhere near the room where we encountered the halflings. Once we found the halflings  we killed them, but I want to precise that Tarlandur wanted to kill one, because he was afraid of a possible reinforcements, and of the impossibility of accessing the dungeon through that entrance in the future, if guarder. The cold-blooded assassination was not even a moral dilemma, or an obstacle of consciousness for Tarlandur, since he’s secretly an assassin, secretly called Gizajon, playing as a coward fighter. This attitude has undoubtedly exposed him a little. 

The other halfling should have stayed alive, but Reijo intervened killing him. We both turned into Chaotic Evil aligned characters, even when our intentions were not chaotic. Tarlandur was trying to prevent something bad happening to his party by using the easiest path, violence in this case, while Reijo aimed for an injury, not a kill. I’m not stating that we should have not turned CE, nor I’m trying to prove that our Dungeon Master is in the wrong. 
Instead I’m observing that our alignment is defined by how people around us perceive our intents and actions. Which is an interesting mechanic, because you can’t predict someones intents by their actions. 

If a cleric during an encounter decides to murder ten NPCs because he’s almost convinced that they are members of a fanatic religion that worships the evil Triple-Whisker Carp, is this considered chaotic and evil? Deep down the character (not the player) is convinced that the action he’s prepared to take will define his intent, but in the eyes of the observers he looks just like a mad clergyman. In our case the two half-men were almost undoubtedly evil aligned NPCs. Tarlandur was firmly convinced about that, since a halfling sold him the venomous substance, and the rumors of a poison factory led him and Tabudai in that zone, but as explained with the clergyman example, the alignment mechanic works differently. And this is my statement. I should be more careful with Tarlandur. 

<a name="fn3">[[3]](#nf3)</a> Talking about carefulness: I think that we angered the crime gods. We left a lot of corpses in the fort’s dungeon, and we freed a witness. A lot of bad decisions were made today. As a character and a player I think that the smartest move is to take precautions. Destroy (not sell) anything that made us distinctive: change our clothes, shave our beards and hair, hide our pets, replace our weapons, etc. Maybe even changing town wouldn't be a bad idea. I still have to think about it. Time is running out

<a name="fn2">[[2]](#nf2)</a> While the characters choose violence, the players choose role-playing, to avoid dice-throwing as much as possible, which would entrust their fate to probability, a portentous ally, a fearful enemy. It seems to me that players who role-play are advantaged, but it obviously depends on the DM and his/her play style. In our chase role-playing will let us skip some ability checks and other DM stuff. 
Sometimes the RP will result as a heavy method acting session. Just kidding. 
What I want to expose here is the sacrifice of the role-player. The poor scapegoat must stage things that he’s character would do. Sometimes it could happen that the scapegoat must stage acts that disgust the same player. In my case: torturing the orcs. A small sacrifice for saving some time, and it may also be a “playful” interaction for some players. 
My RP approach makes sense if you’re playing AD&D (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, 1st edition) of course, or some other semi-hardcore TTRPG (Table Top Role Playing Game).

I have nothing else to comment. The playing session was pretty straight-forward. The halflings and orcs were grumpy and arrogant as they should be as outlaws hiding some dirty business inside an abandoned fort.
