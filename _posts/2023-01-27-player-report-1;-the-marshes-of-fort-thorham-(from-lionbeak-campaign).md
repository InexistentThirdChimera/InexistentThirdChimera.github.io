On the 27th of Fireseek 592 CY the party decides to reach Thorham Fort [^1], leaving once again Sukut Nabir (Arden Vul) waiting for us. The Fort was probably built during the golden times of the Arconts, as the elders of the village of Thornham suggested. 
They also suggested that a catastrophe, that took place a long time ago, could have caused the abandonment of the Fort. As we know, the Arcontean Imperium was at its peak 1200 years ago. 
Now the fort is collapsing, and the placid marshes are besieging its ruins. 

To reach it, the party (Tabudai, Tarlandur, May, Roijo, Elmo and Klibo) has rented a swamp boat [^2] from a curious character named Stan[^3], who keeps his business going in the town of Gosterwick, the second major settlement in the Burdock Valley. The first one is Atuk Re. 

After renting a boat for 70g, no contract signed, the party is given a ride by a company of seamen, sailing south by river, from Gosterwick to Atuk Re. The rented boat will later serve as a vehicle to reach the fort hidden in the swamp, unreachable by larger ships with a long keel. The party reaches the Fort as planned. Itâ€™s 4-5pm. The sun is settling. 
The party is tired. We enter the castle and camp inside the only fortified room left: the central room. The party will find comfort in that room for the next few days. The gaming session ends.

[^1]With new players, that never touched a D&D game (May and Roijo), we wisely and democratically decided to forget about Sukut Nabir and its dungerous dungeons. Instead, we have chosen to explore a forgotten Fort, placed inside a watery marsh, somewhere in a forest where I (Tarlandur) and Tabudai have previously investigated a production of smuggled poison. Back then we discovered that the sale of poison inside "The Baton" Inn in Gosterwick was indirectly financed by Joe Belongi, the boss of Amund Fort, Capital City of Lionbeak. But this is a different story, isn't it? 

I would like to think that the Fort is somehow linked to the poison business, but at the same time I'm convinced that there's almost nothing inside that fort, and both possibilities thrill me. How cool would it be to find nothing in an abandoned Fort? I really like to think it like that. You're walking down the mushy green stairs of the fort leading into the dungeons...and there comes nothing. 
Empty cells, empty barrels, spider-webs here and there, the smell of mold and rock saturating the cold room. What where you expecting? 
A giant humanoid dragonfly asking for a favor in exchange of its eggs? C'mon. Actually, while I'm thinking about the dragonfly I'm starting to find it interesting. Never-mind.

[^2] I really missed the feeling of being able to hatch a plan to solve problems. Even if sometimes there are no problems, or should I precise: when there are no relevant problems and you're building problems out of nowhere just because you want to solve one. 
I'm mentioning this because we faced the swamp issue on the 27th of Fireseek. The party observed that if we are a leg deep inside the swamp, while we are trying to reach the Fort, we would be very vulnerable. You should always take into account that you're playing inside a fantasy world and consequently: weird happenings are a norm of reality. So expecting to see a giant frog jumping out of the thick cane fields and devouring one of our companions is completely normal.

This expectation are even stronger, more solid, when an old farmer who lives near the Fort warns you of the presence of such a monster, even if he made it up to scare his children. And this, I believe, is a really interesting phenomenon to take in consideration as a player. 
When your mother tells you to beware of the robbers you believe her, and when you grow up you still believe that the robbers are quite dangerous people. But when she scares you with fairy tales about trolls and goblins (what kinda mother would scare his canny child with such horrifying stories) and you eventually grow up with no mental disorders, you will eventually stop believing in such creatures. 
On the other hand, in a fantasy world, this maternal warning would have a different effect, a different meaning, a different purpose. So, returning to where I've stared: the difficulty lies, as a player and a character, in distinguishing children's rumor from reality. I really do love this.

We solved the "difficult terrain" problem by renting, a boat. We had also thought of buying wooden planks from a carpenter and laying them down to make a path. But the boards would sink in the muddy water, sooner or later.

[^3]I should also comment the curious and incredibly-well-improvised character of Stan, "The Last Boat Vendor". A frenetic, convincing, Soul Goodman-ish vendor. I felt that a character of palpable thickens, with an interesting backstory-even if not exposed, was trying to sell me a boat for a ludicrous price (2500g for a tub). He felt very real, even if we spoke to him only for 10 minutes, or even less. Stan didn't have a stressed accent, he didn't have an accent at all. I remember that he composed his phrases with an unusual rhythm, and his insistence and tenacity were very strong.
He was also obsessed with boat seat padding.

I must admit that characters with a marked rhythm of speech and obsessions are often more interesting then characters with a thick accent. Combine both things and you should achieve a satisfying result. 
During the end of our conversation the seller began to mention fragments of our daily life, but in small bites, I rectify. I think that in that moment, as a player, a spark ignited my interest even more. What was his story? Why he considered himself the last boat vendor?
I would have liked to spend more time arguing with Stan, but the fishermen ship traveling to Atuk Re was waiting for us.
