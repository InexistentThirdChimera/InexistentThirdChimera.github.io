“You! Yes, you. Did you really heard about someone that wants to cross Ascom? Are they completely out of their mind? Have they become greedy because of that bombastic traveler that passed through our village, carrying rusty junk and flanky trinkets? That guy was just an elf, disguised as a Human! Damned be thy, Canny Childe, with your perverse games! 
Well. If they really want to dive deep into Ascom, we should refresh their memory one last time before they die, tearful under the tree crowns. 

This old-growth thick forest that surrounds our shelter all around us, see? We call it Ascom. Its fungal roots spread all around, clinging undwelled buried ruins of unremembered times. Our shelter was, is, a ruin. A human one. As humans we are able to survive, while elves stand by and watch, hidden somewhere in the verdant Ascom. Fucking sloomits, they're everywhere. Courage to explore this dangerous world they have none, otherwise they would leave us in peace. This means that no one knows what this land looks like beyond their shelter, but a bunch of curious stories about Ascom, often spoken by the oldest or the madmen, intrigue the most unconscious, as you saw by yourself. 
All creatures that we know, or that we are able to remember of, live under the foliage of the immortal Ascom. We are all parasites to this world. We eat what Ascom has to offer, we can consider ourselves lucky for this. Even if our existence is blessed by the piercing rays of the pale midday sun, it is in fact continuously obscured by the mere surviving trial in the mutating wilderness. 

Yes. Mutating, because Ascom mutates rapidly, and the creatures frequently die due the impossibility to adapt to a new bio system. The genotypes of monsters and plants mutates uncontrollably, consequently the phenotypes expose different characteristics every month, week, or even day. Sometimes a fruit could be deliciously sweet, sometimes it could be incredibly poisonous, meaning that the uncertain death of old creatures is juxtaposed against the exciting birth of the new ones. 

What else? Of course! I mentioned our village, our shelter, Duru-Rana. Leaving our beloved home is probably the worst fate you can choose! Why do you want to leave this beautiful underground tower? It's warm, we even had an increased production of food this year! More roasted crickets and caterpillar's soups for everyone! We always have plenty of work: casting metal, melding ceramics, cutting roots, bio power harvesting. We, humans, are not heroic warriors! What is that look? You never heard anything about Ascom, haven’t you? Not a single fairy-tale. You hoodwinked me! But you’re not an elf, nor you were born in Duru Rana? No, you’re not even a fool, stranger. But you’ll be a madman if you want to push them inside Ascom. I will not help you! Never, ever! -[elf image] That old grumpy man will not help you, human. Come closer and take this. You’ll not regret it. This is my tome, read it as much as you want, if you want to have fun.
