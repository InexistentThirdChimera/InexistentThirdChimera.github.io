        From The Patched Tongue Canticle:
    </h3>
  
    <p class="gfg">
       “Be aware of the wind cacophony, disciple. Eight Winds are held to be of special significance by the Elves, who, by the secret art that is theirs, do call them from out of the very depths of Ascom. Likewise, among certain cunning folk of more meager realms the art of Whistling Down the Wind is known.”

Eight winds are originated from the bottoms of the eight hidden Bulwarks, which are placed on eight different points and well disguised deep in the ascomian forest. Each bulwark has it’s own history and mysteries, and so each wind. It’s proverbial among the Elves that winds carry whispered stories of past events, which will be heard as cacophonous melodies by untrained ears. 
It’s said that the wind currents will travel the same path forever and every creature will hear the carried laments. The Elves are also aware that at the bottom of each bulwark a gate leads to an uncanny place. One of this gates was forever closed: the gate to Surrealm.
Because the eight bulwarks are different in structure, dimensions and origin it’s hard to discover them, consequently some of them remain undiscovered. Moreover, tracking the winds seems an impossible challenge.

        From The Almanac of the Whistling Art:
    </h3>
  
    <p class="gfg">
       “Every spell is an echo of the past, and the Surrealm is the place where all the echoes are stored. And when an echo leave the Surrealm it morphs into a wind.”

With the desire of imitating the sound of the eight winds and through bizarre metallurgical and sonic arts, the Elves have developed wind instruments of chrome metal, and playing certain melodies upon them brings down the wind. Wiser Elves merely whistle with their fingers, or upon an ancient horse-bone flute. A reproduction of the sound of a specific wind will summon its powers, but weather and seasons must be right or the wind will disobediently dissipate and all be becalmed.
