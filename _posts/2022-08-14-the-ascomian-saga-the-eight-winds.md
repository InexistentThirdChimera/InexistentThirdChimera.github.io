Each wind has its own place of origin, each zone has a possibility to host one or more winds.
When the sounds and the natural movements of a Wind are reproduced it’s called Cacophony.

<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 900;">
            Major Grassrustler
          </span>  – a strong and rumbling wind, precursor of storms and nightmares. This wind carries no sound, nor song.
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">
            Minor  Grassrustler
          </span> – deathly quiet and dry wind able to make living objects invisible. Predatory animals have a higher chance to appear in the zones where this wind blows. This wind carries no sound.
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">
            Cavalcader
          </span> – warm gust of wind able to make living objects levitate. It will often carry flowers and smaller animals. Echoed neighs can be heard when the Cavalcader blows strong. 
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">
            The Prince Wind
          </span> – blazing hot wind originated in the region of the High-path Junction, able to burn living objects. It will often carry flickering sparks and ember. Muffled war cries can be heard when the Prince Wind blows.
 </p>
 <p>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">
            Major Sickler
          </span> – a humid and slack wind able to force someone to take what does not belong to him/her. Used for the High Cacophony Ritual during the High Cacophony Feast. Steller Jay's hushed singing can be heard when the Major Sickler blows strong.
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">
            Minor Sickler
          </span> – a warm wind originated from the Hills of Udinies, inflicts drowsiness, forcing living objects to sleep. A muffled lullaby can be heard when the Minor Sickler blows strong.
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">
            Unarmed Man
          </span> – a wintery and insistent wind. Harmless except for the cold. Sobbing cries can be heard when the Unarmed Man blows strong. Not to be confused with the Petrolic Stroke.
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 900;">
            Petrolic Stroke
          </span> – a humid and smelly wind originated in the region of the Petrolic Swamps. Harmless except for the bad odor. Slurred calls of desperate help can be heard when the Petrolic Stroke blows strong.
