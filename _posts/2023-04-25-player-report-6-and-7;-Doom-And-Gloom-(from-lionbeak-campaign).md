Slaves to Set chapter reached a watershed.

Today is the 17th of Coldeven. As I already mentioned in the previous report, we found those runaway slaves inside one of the caves north of the Forum of Set. We returned the runaways to their rightful owner, Stefania, who decided to reward us (as slaves) with one day of freedom per week. So, from now on, every first day of the week, we can enjoy the sunlight for 24 hours. We thanked Stefania and asked how we could buy our freedom. She replied that it would cost 4000 gold coins and bringing her some slaves to replace our absence. 

Then, Tabudai, as usual, made some stupid and inappropriate comments. He loudly questioned Stefania's gift and asked what she would gain from it. She was perceptibly irritated and revoked Tabudai's permission to enjoy the Lady of the Forum's gift. The hunchbacked wizard will be the only member of our group who will not benefit from it.

We took a few hours of rest while Basileus attended to some private affairs, probably with the runaway slaves we caught. We had time to sell the Jade Monkey statue and made enough money to buy two healing potions each, a Knock magic scroll, and a vial of Whispering Madness poison. Moreover, we met an old acquaintance of Tabudai and Tarlandur, Mirko Toppollo, the magic items vendor, but that's another story I will tell later.

Basileus told us we need to work, and so we did. We ventured further north into the caves, passing through the room where Klibo lost his life due to a giant lizard. Speaking of giant lizards, we encountered two of them again today and killed them both <a name="nf1"><sup>[[1]](#fn1)</sup><a>. 

The fight was more fun than usual, and I realized why. I came to two conclusions: first, the fight is fun because it's easy. I should say, it has become easy to fight these creatures after we discovered their weaknesses and acquired new abilities and new members. It should be noted that Basileus is a powerful ally, and his workforce is palpable. I also sympathize with him. Tarlandur likes his stoicism <a name="nf2"><sup>[[2]](#fn2)</sup><a>. Second, fighting in the caves is fun. Because the positioning of long-range attackers matters in tight spaces. Hitting allies is much easier, and even though hitting an ally by mistake seems rarer than severe, it should be remembered that level 1 melee characters have few hit points, and one or two stray arrows could instantly knock them down. I feel like I'm a careful player, and this mechanic has only recently become so relevant. It's a beautiful game-play mechanic because it's punitive in the right way.

The game session ended with the discovery of a decent treasure, consisting of magic scrolls, gold, and a magical quiver that allowed Tarladur to advance to level 3. Finally <a name="nf3"><sup>[[3]](#fn3)</sup><a>.
  
We played again a few days later. It was the 23rd of Coldeven. The group decided to continue exploring the caves to the north, venturing into increasingly narrow and dangerous spaces. I say dangerous because that day we encountered three Owlbears and we faced them, but without much success. The encounter began at line of sight and immediately launched into an initiative check. After a few sword strikes and many arrows shot, we decided to make a strategic retreat. The idea seemed good, except that we left Basileus behind, lying under the claws of one of the beasts. Nevertheless, we opted for escape, ignoring Basileus' condition. We managed to flee, leaving our slave-lord to fight. We thought we had lost him forever, but he limped out of the darkness, wounded and angry . The last words we heard before the end of that gaming session were, "You are dead."

<a name="fn1">[[1]](#nf1)</a> At this point the Set arc feels very straightforward. We fight, we loot, we rest. Nothing more, nothing less. Yes! We won our day of freedom, but as Tabudai's player pointed out through his character voice: there's no gain, not for Stefania, nor for us. And I've been thinking about it for a few days. A thought boggled my mind: the slave experience is deeply realistic, and this is a good thing; but the game-play became monotonous, and for this reason (and many others) the exploration became slow, the thrill disappears quickly. The chapter of Set is indeed a gloomy and a dark one. 

Should it be like that? As a player with a far-sighted gaze my answer would be positive. The slave experience should be a trauma, making life-or -death decisions should be extremely hard, especially when we are "under trial". 

<a name="fn2">[[2]](#nf2)</a> Let's talk about Basileus. If you have read previous reports you will already know that Basileus is Stefania's right hand, and that he's been following us like a shadow, making sure that we are working as hard as any other slave.

I have observed that he's an inconsistent character in his reasoning and decision-making. It is often up to us to prod him, goad him, and encourage him to take notice of a situation. I perceive him as a rather passive character, more like a guard than a slave-driving leader. If each of us is worth 4000 pieces of gold and we are treated as high-ranking slaves (a very rare type of slave in the Forum of Set), I do not see why he should not warn us of dangers we might face - like Owlbears. He would risk losing twelve thousand gold coins in just a few seconds, as well as his own life.

Speaking of inconsistency, a few weeks ago he told us to flee from a hidden area of the caves, but today, knowing that we were facing an overwhelmingly difficult challenge, yet he did not stop us. Additionally, we asked Basileus if he could find us a slaughter-slave (although Tabudai was morally and ethically opposed) so that we could replace Klibo in battle. The Forum of Set is teeming with slaves, yet Basileus did not find even one that we could use as described above. The DM rolled a die to decide whether Basileus would find a slave or not. Naturally, the die roll was negative.

Basileus is a well-defined, stoic character, abounding in mysteries, and his figure is powerful and well-drawn, but sometimes the logic behind his behavior leaves something to be desired. It's unfortunate that a character of his stature has to be weakened or handicapped in order to prevent players from exploiting it. Basileus reminds me of Colonel Walter Kurtz, portrayed by Marlon Brando in Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979). 

I know it's part of the game-play that some NPCs must behave as NPCs, but they often feel "locked", as you can't extrapolate too much information from them. It just occurred to me that when an NPC is plotting against us, or behaves badly towards us, it feels more realistic, as if he/she was more inclined to show his/her emotions and character. I would like to have genuine, realistic, fruitful interactions with NPCs when I play and old-school RPG. 

I also believe that my observations might be superficial, due to the lack of NPCs encounters, or simply because our group is pretty good at instigating people (see: Tabudai), or because we are not the main characters of this world and many NPCs that we met along the road were actually indifferent towards us. 

<a name="fn3">[[3]](#nf3)</a> Last but not least: I've been thinking about this for lot, probably since our first OSR RPG, Barrowmaze. Our characters are in a constant gold-experience starvation. Our exploration process is slow, but constant. We dwell into the deepest corners of the dungeon, we slay what is slay-able, we loot what is loot-able. Yet treasure and gold are nowhere to see. My brother, who recently started DMing Castle Xyntillan, acknowledged me that his players are not much faster then we are, yet their character levels are raising and raising. Now, I’m not mad, or in discomfort, I’m just curious. If finding treasures is a result of the exploration of the unexplored dungeon holes, and our pace of exploration is decent, then what explains our lack of success here?
Probably we are not doing enough, or maybe we always choose to play empty-dungeon crawler campaigns. I’m almost sure that the true reason behind it, is the first I’ve mentioned in the previous phrase. 
I don’t know about you reader, but I prefer to explore with caution, evading death if it’s in my control. Silver and gold will be more tasty, when looted with successful strategies.
