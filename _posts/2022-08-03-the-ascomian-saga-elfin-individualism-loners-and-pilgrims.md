As immortal beings they preferred individualism to the collectivism. Everything was reachable, at their fingertips, with enough time and dedication, fortune and foresight. There was no practical need for villages, towns or capitals. Every elf lived its own life, mostly alone, for centuries. 
Elfin loners were the most common nomadic creatures before the First Oxidation, the most unpredictable and yet among the friendliest fiends under the foliage of Ascom. They traveled far and wide, before camping to rest their errant feet, store newfound treasures, and lock and key curious secrets. This “pilgrimages” were considered as such because traveling from place to place, and consequently finding a secret, induced the Elves to self-growth. 
During those forgotten times roads did not exist, but directions and signs were marked with inscriptions, wood-carved signs or tokens. Elves used to keep track of those signs with small globe-like maps made of everlasting materials, like rock. On this particular maps Elves also used to mark secrets, but only in extraordinary occasions.  
While fear of death was not an Elfin matter, losing a secret was a constant dread. This condition molded zealous individuals capable of employing bestial physical strength while unchaining the most unspeakable spells known to men, just to protect one’s treasure. 
The daily life of an Elf would mostly consist in barefoot traveling, hunting, sleeping and wasting time. An Elf would usually travel by jumping from branch to branch, or by simply walking on the ground. Hunting was unnaturally violent and cathartic. Elfin sleep was lethargic, it could last a week, even months or years. Wasting time consisted in casual experimentation of things.
