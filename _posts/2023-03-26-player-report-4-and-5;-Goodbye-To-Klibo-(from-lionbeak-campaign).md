This report includes two days of play. The first day an alluring encounter stimulated our interest. The second day was rather sad, due to a death. I shall start recounting the first day. 

Itâ€™s the 13th of Coldeven. Year 592 CY. After being enslaved almost a month ago we (Tabudai, Tarlandur, May, Reijo, Klibo and Elmo) started to explore the caverns under the watchful eye of Basileus. One of the multiple cave corridors to the east led us to a sandy cave. A spear wrapped in snake skin was plunged in the sand, right in the middle of the room <a name="nf2"><sup>[[2]](#fn2)</sup><a>. We left that room untouched, after listing various interpretations of the sight. The most popular one was the idea that the spear served as a snake warning sign. 

The second cave we explored hid a secret. Its reveal was defined as a game-changer by the DM. The cave in question was covered in yellow mold . We tried to burn a sample of it to ensure that it was not a dangerous mycelium. The mold did not catch fire, so we inspected the room, confident that the mold had no fire-resistant or poisonous properties. Tabudai then discovered a hidden hole, or should I say: a descending entrance, with steps carved into the rock. The secret entrance led us to a room with three blindfolded men chained to the walls ; a single chair, a table with a cup and some jugs were placed in the middle of the room. Basileus, with terror in his eyes - as we have never seen him before (not that we have seen him in other circumstances), advised us to run away, and so we did <a name="nf1"><sup>[[1]](#fn1)</sup><a>. The session ended and a week went by.

On the 25th of Coldeven we (Tabudai, Tarlandur, Reijo, Klibo and Elmo) delved into the corridors extending in north-west part of the unexplored territory. During the first ten minutes of the game, we tried to understand if there were any discrepancies in the Forum's laws issued by the Lord of the Forum-Stefania, as Basileus revealed, but we understood that the Forum law protects mostly merchants and their business. We wanted to circumvent the law to guarantee our freedom. Apparently, the union has not yet been devised (or implemented). After those ten minutes spent thinking, we finally decided to take action.

We headed towards the first cave after the first crossroad. We were immediately surprised by an unpleasant encounter: two giant lizards roared at us. We faced them with courage and experience, having already faced them in the past, inside the fungi caverns, near the territory of Beast-men. With some new tactics (Tabudai permanently blinded one of the lizards with sorcery) and with Basileus's help, we defeated the lizards, but we lost Klibo, who was fatally smacked against the wall by a tail swipe. A sad news, given that Klibo has been with us for a long time, and his courage has inspired many of our actions. With the occurrence of his death, we recalled his origins: he was born in a royal family (as noble as goblins can be). He is the son of a king of the Black Mountains, somewhere east from Verbobonc. We hope his words were not goblin lies, because once we are free, we will send our condolences to someone in those lands.

Remaining clear-headed and maintaining some dignity, we plundered his body of anything useful (a crowbar and arrows) before adjusting his body in the nearby underground river <a name="nf3"><sup>[[3]](#fn3)</sup><a>. Tabudai advised Tarlandur to gut the lizards because they may contain devoured treasures. Tarlandur agreed, but upon gutting them, he found nothing but blood and stench of entrails.

At this point we knew that: with one casualty, several injured men, and Tabudai with no more spells, we desperately needed a night of rest. We asked Basileus if we can purchase healing potions from the Forum's merchants. His answer was positive, he specified that if we find some gold, we could use it to buy potions, but clarifying that any treasure we find must be handed to him or his superiors. The next day we looted a very symbolic statue deeper within the caves: a monkey with six arms, two legs, and a blue gem embedded in its belly. We handled it with a cloth, being careful not to touch it. We also tried to cover our eyes, nose, and mouth, imitating the statue. We hoped for something to happened, but got left high and dry.

We continue our exploration after securing the statue in Tabudai's backpack. Further on, we find a corridor that seems to lead to a very hot area. Basileus warns us that the temperature is rising above 50 degrees Celsius. We decide to turn back, imagining our hypothetical escape from a fire monster, risking a heart attack due to the unbearable heat and high humidity <a name="nf4"><sup>[[4]](#fn4)</sup><a>.
We continue on the opposite side of the corridor. We peek into a cave containing nests made out of meat. We don't investigate further as it seems dangerous. We decide to go back to where we killed the lizards and take an undwelled corridor that leads us to a dead-end. And here we find five crooked fugitives, probably of low rank. Basileus is pleased, and maybe someone else is too. The session ends. Tarlandur has almost reached the third level.

<a name="fn1">[[1]](#nf1)</a> I've recently noticed how symbolic the Forum of Set might be, and how the symbolism powers a suggestive storytelling, adding depth and insightfulness to the game world. Moreover, I am absolutely fascinated by symbolism and specifically; an interactive symbolism-signs, traces, people, objects that you can investigate on, understanding why they are presented to you in a specific location, during a certain occasion, in a well-defined state. The spear wrapped in snake skin and the yellow mold-covered cave, for example, could represent danger and corruption respectively. We thought that those blind-folded men were now blood-sacks for a vampire. The single chair, the amphora that could have contained blood, and the fear of Basileus were evidence of the presence of something powerful and intelligent, perhaps a humanoid. We read the room as if it wanted to symbolize a story, or as if it wanted to describe its landlord. These symbols can be used to foreshadow future events, convey themes and ideas, and create a sense of continuity within the game world. Maybe Set and it's adepts are weak compared to what lies in that room. I would like to deepen the theme of interactive symbolism with a separate article.

<a name="fn2">[[2]](#nf2)</a> The power of suggestion is another crucial element of effective storytelling. By dropping hints, clues, and warnings, the DM created tension, built suspense, and guided us toward certain choices and actions. The warning from Basileus about the blindfolded prisoners, for example, created a sense of urgency and fear that ultimately led the party to flee. This highlights the importance of suggestion in driving the narrative and engaging players in the story. Somehow becoming slaves made us suggestible to the prejudices of Basileus and Stefania, probably because exploring as slaves of a powerful Lord makes us feel safe and listening to their advice is the safest thing to do, even if we get influenced by their ideas. 
The use of symbolism and the power of suggestion can work together to create a bond between the players and the game world. Symbols can be used to hint at future events, while suggestions can heighten the player's sense of anticipation and investment in the story. For example, the spear wrapped in snake skin could symbolize danger, but a suggestion from the DM that a snake monster has been spotted in the area could increase the player's sense of urgency and create a more immersive, realistic and "trustful" environment.

<a name="fn3">[[3]](#nf3)</a> The group's decision to loot Klibo's body and then dispose of it in the underground river may seem callous and lacking in empathy, but it also reflects the harsh reality of survival in a dangerous environment where resources are scarce and every item and piece of equipment could mean the difference between life and death. With this attitude and given that we were able to defeat two giant lizards with new tactics and spells, we demonstrated our capabilities of handling dangerous situations. However, we still suffered a casualty, which reminded us of the risks and dangers of exploring caves and dungeons.

<a name="fn4">[[4]](#nf4)</a> Basileus's warning about the high temperature in the corridor leading to the hot area shows that he cares a little about the group's safety and well-being, even though he is technically our captor. Maybe it's because we are not mere slaves, and finding fighters is not an easy task. However, this raises questions about his true motivations and intentions, and whether he is simply following orders or has his own agenda. I think it would be an interesting plot-twist if we could befriend him in the distant future. As we would do with every mysterious NPC, we want to explore Basileus backstory.
