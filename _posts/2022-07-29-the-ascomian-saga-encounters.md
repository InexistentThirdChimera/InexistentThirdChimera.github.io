  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>The Saint</td>
    <td>A bony man from another era. He doesn't speak much, he will only claim to love the forest of Ascom. If encountered near a human church he will let the players know that they should not ring the bell, otherwise a piece of the church will fall on his heads. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
