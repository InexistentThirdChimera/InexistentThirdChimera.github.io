On the 26th of Patchwall, yet even with the trial looming, the dungeons beckoned us with the promise of wealth. We raided straight to the secondary entrance of Arden Vul, in search for richness. We were hungry for gold, gems and artefacts. In a a cave just east of the Underground Mushroom Forest (which we'll soon discover to whom it righteously belongs), we stumbled upon a surreal scene: three Mephistophelean winged creatures, resplendent in their bizarre attire, frolicking around a flamming pillar. They were whimsical, dressed in ornate rags, eccentric shoes, and fancy tubas their dance and muble an arcane ritual to the flames that leapt before them. Smoking sticks and singing licks. Reijo, with a courage that bordered on folly, approached the creatures, drawn in by their hypnotic dramaturgical play. The encounter took a turn for the peculiar as they offered him a puff of strange mushrooms. The consequences were immediate and psychedelic; Reijo was plunged into a hallucinogenic trance as the pranksters vanished, leaving us behind unharmed, in silence as perplexing as their presence.

After the devilish encounter we stumbled upon a patrol of beastmen cartographers, in the process of mapping the cavernous corridors. We convinced them to join us, or should I rather say: we convinced them that we are harmless and we could possibily follow them from far away. A cooperative exploration. Netherless to say: we started off on the wrong foot, literally. Tarlandur stepped on a trap that the beastmen set before our eyes. The half-orc assassin was heavily injured, so he had to rest for 6 days, while Tabudai and Nox sniffed the city around.  

After six days of rest and relax we resumed the exploration, heading towards the halfling-less entrance. Along the corridors near the entrance, we encountered a creature resembling a giant centipede, three meters long, hidden inside a pair of rotten, funky corpses. The creature unscrewed from the cadavers in a macabre dance, and before anyone could react, it managed to paralyze Tarlandur. Quick thinking by Tabudai put the creature to sleep, and Nox dealt the final blow. Tarlandur harvested three of its paralyzing tentacles.

Further exploration brought us to a cavern where an old cooking spot was set atop a big rock, towering the room. Some pots were displaced around the forgotten firebone, where a few pink juicy mushrooms (Acquavitae mushrooms) were growing undisturbed, rumored to have healing properties according to nearby beastmen guards. Luckily they blurt out an old recipe for the mushrooms. The recipe was simple: fry them with a bit of oil. As we proceeded deeper into the dungeon-dwelling, we approached the ruins of an old temple facing the Mushroom forest, where we met a ragged man seated on a red stone throne. He welcomely shouted a greating, introducing himself as Lord Ptarmis, the ruler of the Mushroom forest, and expected us to pay homage. We embraced the curiosity, ready to salute the ruler. The session ended.
