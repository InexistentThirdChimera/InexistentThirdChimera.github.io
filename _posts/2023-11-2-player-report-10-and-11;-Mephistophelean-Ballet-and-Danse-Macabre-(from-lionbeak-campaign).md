On the 26th of Patchwall, yet even with the trial looming, the dungeons beckoned us with the promise of wealth. We raided straight to the secondary entrance of Arden Vul, in search for richness. We were hungry for gold, gems and artefacts. In a a cave just east of the Underground Mushroom Forest (which we'll soon discover to whom it righteously belongs), we stumbled upon a surreal scene: three Mephistophelean winged creatures, resplendent in their bizarre attire, frolicking around a flamming pillar. They were whimsical, dressed in ornate rags and eccentric shoes, their dance and muble an arcane ritual to the flames that leapt before them. Smoking sticks and singing licks. Reijo, with a courage that bordered on folly, approached the creatures, drawn in by their hypnotic dramaturgical play. The encounter took a turn for the peculiar as they offered him a puff of strange mushrooms. The consequences were immediate and psychedelic; Reijo was plunged into a hallucinogenic trance as the pranksters vanished, leaving us behind unharmed, in silence as perplexing as their presence.
