The full party is back in Sukut Nabir (Arden Vul), looking for an eventful adventure <a name="nf1"><sup>[[1]](#fn1)</sup><a> while keeping a low profile after the murderous crime the party committed a few weeks before.
Reijo and May never explored the dungeon before, but dwelling in the Forum of Set seemed a safe route to begin with. Needles to say, we got tricked. 

It’s the 3rd of Coldeven. Year 592 CY. The party descends into the antechambers of the "Forum of Set", so called by locals. We suddenly remember of the existence of a lookout room (found a few months ago), where some guards devoted to Set are keeping watch over their territory. We ask them if someone could take us to the Forum, for a generous tip. A sneering guard accepts the task and guides us through rooms and corridors, which are often adorned with macabre frescoes and reliefs depicting slavery.
Assuming that these scenes are the daily occurrence of this world; the party did not react too cathartically. We proceeded until we entered into what seemed to be the main plaza of the Forum. 
A big statue placed in the center of the room, representing the old god Set, welcomed our arrival.
On the right side of the room many slaves were unleashing their despair in screams and cries, while on the left side slave owners and clients merrily chatted and feasted on exotic banquets. 
Here comes the show: Fafrd, the guard who accompanied us and got paid for it, invited us to pray to Set under the god’s statue, as a traditional ritual performed by all those who set foot in the Forum.

He insisted that the prayers must be sincere, so the guards can distinguish the weak from the strong. So, like a herd of lambs, we began to pray. Some asked for power, some for protection, others didn’t recite the prayer out loud, but as anticipated: we got tricked <a name="nf2"><sup>[[2]](#fn2)</sup><a>. The full party, except Reijo, was suddenly paralyzed during the praying ritual, as some guards approached us and put us in chains.  Reijo watched the entire scene motionlessly. His body and soul were paralyzed by fear, he couldn’t save us there.
Tabudai, Tarlandur, Hotage, May, Klibo and Elmo got miserably locked in a room somewhere in the north part of the Forum, deprived of their belongings, gagged and chained in the dark. A few minutes pass and a muscular, bald man with a goatee approaches them, asking each of the locked up their professions. Tarlandur revealed that he’s a paid assassin, while May presented herself as a fighter, a warrior. The same did Elmo and Klibo. Hotage introduced himself as a scholar of magical arts. On the other hand: Tabudai lied to the slaver, telling him of his dishwasher career. Annoyed by the hunchback’s (Tabudai) attitude the man in charge transferred Tabudai in a less-privileged room, where he was almost beaten to death with other slaves. 

The bald slaver left, just to be replaced by a woman named Stefania. We’ve heard her name before, more precisely on the 8th of Patchwall 591CY, when Tabudai and Tarlandur (me) were enjoying the commodities of the Yellow Coat Inn in Gosterwick. Through chatters we have come to know that Stefania is somehow a relevant representative of the cult. Stefania hired the party, forcing us to work for her <a name="nf3"><sup>[[3]](#fn3)</sup><a>. In the days to come we'll explore and clear the northern tunnels infested with different creatures (wolf-bears and lizard, as mentioned by Stefania).

We all agreed. Finally, a magical chain tattoo was painted on our necks, designed to kill the victim if he, or she, ever decides to run away. The lady demonstrated how the collar works on a pig. She snapped her fingers, the pig got instantly decapitated. Stefania’s henchman, Basileus, will make sure we'll follow her orders. The session ended when the party, headed to the northern caverns, spotted Reijo among the cultists.

<a name="fn1">[[1]](#nf1)</a> Tabudai and I have undoubtedly contributed to the misdeed. We were subconsciously trying to cause a critical situation by ignoring the telegraphed signals of danger. That’s because many moths have passed since something adrenaline-filled happened. It must be pointed out that bad stuff happened to us during the first months, since then we began playing almost too safely, evading possibly interesting encounters, questioning every decision, reconsidering every information. It must be said that we’ve also opted for some reckless choices in recent months, but all things considered, we’ve been mostly cautious. Nevertheless, we didn’t see it coming.
We knew that the old god Set was an evil deity, we saw how people engaged us, how they treated us, how they treated the "weakest" (slaves) by publicly exposing them as trophies of torture.
Yet we persisted on the wrong path, instigating the God of Domination and its liegemen. 
That said, we can't be disappointed, we asked for trouble. 

<a name="fn2">[[2]](#nf2)</a> This situation made me think of the alignment system. The personal experience I am going to share may not be something you can relate to.

Once again Tarlandur is clashing against the alignment dilemma. He is an evil character, he was once lawful, but during the cold blood murders he committed against the halflings and the orcs in Fort Thorham,  he switched to chaotic. The problem is that Tarlandur was evil on paper, not in reality. His actions were mostly good. He followed Tabudai’s actions regardless of perils, he never tricked anyone, he helped his teammates many times, especially offering them money, etc.
Not following the guidelines of an alignment has led to negative repercussions during recent events.

What I’m saying is that if you consider yourself a lion, but you acts as a lamb, you will obviously unseen the ways of the predator, consecutively acting as a prey. If we translate the metaphor into Tarlandur’s dilemma: Tarlandur lost his alignment privileges, being classified as evil wasn't enough to assure his position among evil NPCs, who would speaked his same evil chant (obviously Tarlandur didn’t know that language, he just pretended to know it).
 
I want to conclude this comment making a statement about players abusing of a soft alignment system. When I’m talking about a soft alignment system I’m referring to an alignment system that has no radical or heavy repercussions on the characters that are swinging between extremely good actions and horrifyingly bad exploits. The abusive player is not considering its character desires, the player is only considering the survivability chances of the character, resulting in constant switching between alignments, and never ever gaining an advantage from the alignment system. The player is actually being a smart player that considers every option for the salvation of its character and the party. I should admit that taking actions without considering the alignment is almost always more convenient, because you're not delimiting yourself by choosing one path. 

In a more realistic alignment system redemption should be difficult to achieve, and morally bad actions should be cumulative, sometimes externalizing into the character’s “aura”. 

I will probably change my play-style from now on. I will try to stick to the alignment guidelines. One step at the time. Now a question started boiling in my had: is acting as an evil character similar to acting as an intelligent one? How you can act intelligently, if you are not. How can you act evil, if you’re not.

<a name="fn3">[[3]](#nf3)</a> Django, Conan the Barbarian, Anakin Skywalker, Thrall Son of Durotan, Neo (from Matrix), the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, General Maximus Decimus Meridius, and so on. It seems that every big adventurous tale begins with a slavery arc and a bunch of heroes trying to unchain the world. And so do our story. 

In a world where the law of the strongest prevails over everything, it was obvious that sooner or later we would meet someone who instead of killing without judgment, would use his superiority to enslave the weakest. When your character actively takes part of an event like being captured or enslaved, the first thing that comes through your mind as a player is “can I remember some fictional characters that went through a similar situation and freed themselves? How can I emulate that situation? How can I approximate my situation to theirs?” 

The first thing that come through my mind is Joseph Malik’s “Dragon's Trail", a fantasy novel in which the protagonist, a former slave is forced to work in a mine where he discovers a hidden cave system. He uses his knowledge to escape and sets out on a dangerous journey overthrow his former captors.
What knowledge do we have? None. The first thing we must focus on is the mechanism behind the magical tattooed collars. If we take for granted that in order to activate the magical collar a somatic command (finger snap) must be given, then it should not be to hard to deprive Basileus of the ability to snap his fingers, but we should first understand how strong he is. I expect a henchmen with enough HP to make it impossible to put him to sleep with magic or with poisons created with the current academical experience of Tarlandur.

Given that, we are ready to feel the pressure to break or retreat at every turn, facing the fear of enslavement.
No one can tell how all this will work out, and there’s no “but”.
