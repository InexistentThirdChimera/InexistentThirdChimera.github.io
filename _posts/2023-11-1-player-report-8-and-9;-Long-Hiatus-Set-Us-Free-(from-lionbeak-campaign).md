Our last session on the 23rd of Planting concluded with our characters’ strategic retreat from a lethal skirmish with Owlbears, inadvertently leaving our overseer Basileus to fend for himself. The consequences of this act were severe: months of toil as true slaves within the oppressive confines of the Forum of Set. Whipped and worn, we lost all prior earned privileges, with our only respite being the fractured memories of our suffering and the unforgiving embrace of our chains. A new figure loomed over us, the bald and bearded taskmaster Cenario, under whose watch we served our punishment for the attempted desertion of Basileus, who might be dead or demoted; this part remained unclear.

Our penance concluded on the 17th Patchwall, with the task of clearing a hive of giant lizards. Cunningly, we enlisted the aid of four guards from the Forum that were monitoring the bridge zone, convincing them to join our cause for the glory of Set. The battle was fierce, and victory was ours but not without the sorrow of loss. May, one of our own, met a brutal end in the jaws of a lizard. Her death cast a pall over our victory, and we laid her to rest in a watery grave near the site of her last battle. "Brave May" it's reported on her tomb.

We returned to the Forum headquarters and to Stefania, our slavemaster, who upheld her end of a cruel bargain by granting us freedom. Yet freedom came with a proposition: serve Set willingly and reap benefits or leave and lose the god's favor forever. We took the decision quickly, without too much thinking, and we chose freedom over fealty. We are all free: Tabudai, Tarlandur, Reijo, Hotage Ono, Elmo and the newcomer Nox, a thief and the player behind May’s replacement, who joined us as we tasted the sweet, albeit cold, air of liberty. The pale autumnal sunrays kissed our sick skins. Breathing felt like ingesting and swallowing cold silver nails. We were free again because Set decided so. 

Our newfound freedom led us to unearth a treasure we had secreted away, one I dare not detail for fear of prying eyes. But freedom also brought a sense of responsibility. A chronic episode of withdrawal or a stroke of madness made us return to the Set Forum, in search for some proofs that will help the Church of Mitra eradicate the Cult of Slavery. Back in the Forum we witness the usual 10am slave auction, where we managed to buy a mage slave (who's name I cannot recall) for 800 gold pieces. We set him free, and he angrily left us, but: a document was given to us with the mage, a testament to sinister operations, a proof of purchase,  marked with the seal of the Forum, which proves its existence
It was during the slave auction that we crossed paths with the enigmatic Varumani. We already heard their speech, behind a door in the zone that precedes the Beastmen Town. These archaic beings, hailing from the dawn of Arden Vul and bearing semblances to ancient trolls, spoke in a rhythmically deliberate manner, their words imbued with a primitive yet arcticulated essence. Slavers and merchants dodged as they passed. Their mere presence served as a stark reminder of a hierarchy hiding behind the well-oiled gears of Arden Vul social machinery.

With evicende in one hand, and fear in the other, we leave the Forum of Set forever. We head for Gosterwick, where the cleric of Mitra, the one who commissioned us, awaited our return. With proofs in hand – the collar tattoos, the witnesses, and a damning document from the Forum – we were met with blessings (-1AC). The cleric bestowed upon us a sacred medallion, imbued with the power to alert us of the impending trial set by the Church of Mitra at Amundfort. The sacred medallion will start to glow 14 days before the start of the trial. After 14 days after its activation the medallion will destroy itself.
