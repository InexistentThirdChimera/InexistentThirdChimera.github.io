Our last session on the 23rd of Planting concluded with our characters’ strategic retreat from a lethal skirmish with Owlbears, inadvertently leaving our overseer Basileus to fend for himself. The consequences of this act were severe: months of toil as true slaves within the oppressive confines of the Forum of Set. Whipped and worn, we lost all prior earned privileges, with our only respite being the fractured memories of our suffering and the unforgiving embrace of our chains <a name="nf1"><sup>[[1]](#fn1)</sup><a>. A new figure loomed over us, the bald and bearded taskmaster Cenario, under whose watch we served our punishment for the attempted desertion of Basileus, who might be dead or demoted; this part remained unclear <a name="nf2"><sup>[[2]](#fn2)</sup><a>.

Our penance concluded on the 17th Patchwall, with the task of clearing a hive of giant lizards. Cunningly, we enlisted the aid of four guards from the Forum that were monitoring the bridge zone, convincing them to join our cause for the glory of Set. The battle was fierce, and victory was ours but not without the sorrow of loss. May, one of our own, met a brutal end in the jaws of a lizard. Her death cast a pall over our victory, and we laid her to rest in a watery grave near the site of her last battle. "Brave May" it's reported on her tomb  <a name="nf3"><sup>[[3]](#fn3)</sup><a>.

We returned to the Forum headquarters and to Stefania, our slavemaster, who upheld her end of a cruel bargain by granting us freedom. Yet freedom came with a proposition: serve Set willingly and reap benefits or leave and lose the god's favor forever. We took the decision quickly, without too much thinking, and we chose freedom over fealty. We are all free: Tabudai, Tarlandur, Reijo, Hotage Ono, Elmo and the newcomer Nox, a thief and the player behind May’s replacement, who joined us as we tasted the sweet, albeit cold, air of liberty. The pale autumnal sunrays kissed our sick skins. Breathing felt like ingesting and swallowing cold silver nails. We were free again because Set decided so <a name="nf4"><sup>[[4]](#fn4)</sup><a>. 

Our newfound freedom led us to unearth a treasure we had secreted away, one I dare not detail for fear of prying eyes. But freedom also brought a sense of responsibility. A chronic episode of withdrawal or a stroke of madness made us return to the Set Forum, in search for some proofs that will help the Church of Mitra eradicate the Cult of Slavery. Back in the Forum we witness the usual 10am slave auction, where we managed to buy a mage slave (who's name I cannot recall) for approximately 800 gold pieces. We set him free, and he angrily left us, but: a document was given to us with the mage, a testament to sinister operations, a proof of purchase,  marked with the seal of the Forum, which proves its existence
It was during the slave auction that we crossed paths with the enigmatic Varumani. We already heard their speech, behind a door in the zone that precedes the Beastmen Town. These archaic beings, hailing from the dawn of Arden Vul and bearing semblances to ancient trolls, spoke in a rhythmically deliberate manner, their words imbued with a primitive yet arcticulated essence. Slavers and merchants dodged as they passed. Their mere presence served as a stark reminder of a hierarchy hiding behind the well-oiled gears of Arden Vul social machinery. Reijo enganged a brief conversation with the biggest and talles among the Varumani.

With evidence in one hand, and fear in the other, we leave the Forum of Set forever. We head for Gosterwick, where the cleric of Mitra, the one who commissioned us, awaited our return. With proofs in hand – the collar tattoos, the witnesses, and a damning document from the Forum – we were met with blessings (-1AC). The cleric bestowed upon us a sacred medallion, imbued with the power to alert us of the impending trial set by the Church of Mitra at Amundfort. The sacred medallion will start to glow 14 days before the start of the trial. Fourteen days after its activation the medallion will destroy itself. 
At this point we ended the gaming session, finally heaving a sigh of relief.

<a name="fn1">[[1]](#nf1)</a> Often I feel the disjointing character development. The characters underwnet significant hardships, yet the emotional and psychological impacts of these events on them aren't deeply explored, nor executed. The transition from slaves to free adventurers could, and should have been a fertile ground for character development, yet it seems that we missed an opportunity for richer storytelling and character growth.Right now I would say that the drive to play and explore is more important than the characters growing and changing. Still, part of me wonders if we should have expected more from our DM in terms of driving character development. Perhaps a little nudge or direction could have made our experiences more immersive and our characters' personal journeys more satisfying - which I personally highly value.

<a name="fn2">[[2]](#nf2)</a> In a previous post I've made some observations on Basileus, on how his character, reasonings and decisions feel inconsistent, yet he's a well-defined character, interesting within the context. Cenario is the same, I can say that even if we didn't manage to analyse him deeply. It's clear to me that Cenario and Basileus are the same entity: self-sovereign, stoic in presence, two figures with a clearly defined purpose. One left, the second inherited the role. With this observation I want to expose how efficent and strong is the "role-aura" casted upon a character, and how easy is so transfer it, when the context sets a strong background. 


<a name="fn3">[[3]](#nf3)</a> We keep piling up bodies, don't we? And here’s May, not even a footnote in the grand scheme, just another one for the count. Makes you wonder if we’re doing it all wrong, or if Arden Vul just that unforgiving. Are we just bad at this? It's like we're some sorry bunch convinced we're dancing when we're really just stumbling from one grave marker to the next.
And then, this whole lone-wolf gig. Not a single kindred spirit in all our travels. Odd, isn't it? No hearty backslaps from fellow dungeon delvers or shared nods with grizzled treasure seekers. Is D&D supposed to be this lonesome? Are we just figments in our own bubble narrative, or is everybody else just playing it smarter, staying out of the obituary pages we seem to be writing for ourselves?
Maybe it’s just us, maybe it’s the game. Maybe there’s a whole party out there somewhere, laughing it up, swapping lies about the big one that got away.

So Set—well, Stefania, or was it really just the DM pulling strings—gave us the nod, freedom's sweet release. But let's be honest, weren't we all just a bit tired of the same old dwelling? The grind, the hustle in those forsaken tunnels. It was turning into a dreary slog, a never-ending loop of sleep, explore, kill or be killed.

<a name="fn4">[[4]](#nf4)</a>The DM called it, said the lizard nest was it, the grand finale, before the Third Act, but we all smelt more darkness beyond, more tunnels just itching for the warm kiss of our flickering continual-light-lanterns. Yet, what was there left to do? Had to end somewhere, right? Of course we had many different and interesting encounters during the Slaves to Set period, but keeping the chain dragging until everyone's yawning will eventually spark a mutiny against the game itself. 
I will always rat and rave how fragile is the balance between a realistic narrative and a playable game, which make the game good and enjoyable. Tip one too much, and you're just role-playing your way through a fantasy novel with no surprises. Load too much the other, and you're just rolling dice and crunching numbers, like some sort of accountant.
So, the DM did us a solid. Cut us loose before we all just started gnawing at our collars. Pushed the story where it needed to go because sometimes the narrative’s gotta bow to the game, keep it fresh, keep it alive. Maybe there were more shadows to pierce, more monsters to slay, but...
Freedom, then. Out of the dark and into whatever's next. More than just an escape from tedium, maybe it's a leap into the next grand adventure, or a tumble into chaos. Either way, we keep playing, because that's what you do, right? Keep playing. Why? To answer to this questio I will quote an insightful statement, wrote by web surfer, and it goes by this: 

<p class="gfg">
<blockquote>
"Megadungeons are the type of campaign that separates the meek from the strong. A meek player would quit a few sessions in, citing difficulty or lack of story or "content" to be not of their taste. A pathetic player would not even raise their voice and leave without a world. A bad DM would never see far into the megadungeon, their attention span doesn't last long enough. They want to pick up different campaign idea soon, they god bored too quickly, they bought into the hype and now they regre it and want out.
But strong DM's, strong players, they dive in. They don't think about when this end. They don't think about next session, or previous session. They enjoy the moment, they enjoy the time they have. In Megadungeons you will find true comradeire. The Megadungeon is the father of all OSR."</blockquote>
