Among many men-told stories the Elves of Ascom were often described as mischievous masterminds, sculptors of conundrums, concealers of the many truths, dissimulators of reality.
It would be more appropriate to say that they were the greedy keepers of old secrets and the maker of new ones. Elfin life, culture and costumes were built upon myriads of secrets. 

Knowledge through secrets was achieved with time and luck: jumping down a cliff and discovering a cave containing chrome crystals was considered a secret. Whistling with a severed tongue and summoning one of the Eight Winds was also considered a secret, as it was the result of mixing two powders and blowing them in the direction of the Moon.
Sharing a discovery, or a secret, was considered an act of imprudence and even meekness.  Because a secret kept hidden for a long time would bring power and respect to the Elf concerned. The power of a secret derives directly from its utility potential and the ability of the owner to manipulate knowledge. Depriving oneself of it meant losing a weapon. A secret discovered and shared by many was considered lost, ultimately: a secret known to all became a Proverb (see 4th chapter). Some secrets, of course, tarried in one’s mind and never left. Those were the most powerful secrets.
The mightiest and yet the most infamous secret keeper among Elves was the Invisible Chimera, an Elfin god in-becoming who found out how to morph elves into a humans, a long forgotten sorcery only She knew about.

Elves were born with the innate ability to speak and write. Their brain capabilities were insufficient to store all the knowledge gained with centuries of accumulated discoveries. That’s why they wrote down most of the secrets. Any kind of surface could become a vessel containing general knowledge, spells or other thrusts. A secrets could be displayed on a knife hilt as an encrypted inscription, as it could also be hidden as a puzzle under a rotten corpse, or on a personal globe map, as mentioned before.
