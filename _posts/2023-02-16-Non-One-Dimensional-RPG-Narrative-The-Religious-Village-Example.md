With this brief transcribed thought I would like to express the importance of diversifying the narrative through scenography and role-playing within old-school RPGs 
same-land settings, which are often monotone.
I will try to explain this thought by using the concept of religion within a real historical context.
If you consider OSRs setting the mirror of the real Middle Ages, then you will probably like my words. 

Try to visualize a green land somewhere in the middle of Europe, with small villages displaced in an area of 100 miles, all connected with a small network of cobbled roads.
A few mercantile oxcarts that walk those roads are the only link between one village and another. They bring news, gossips, and survival essentials. The villagers are hunters, gatherers, but mostly farmers, whose only purpose is to survive by procreating and working for the (land)lord. 
Even during his free time the farmer does not waste time. He takes refuge in the largest and richest house, where he dabbles in the beautification of his soul through prayers, so that his existence can be worthwhile, even after death. What he is, what he does, what he wants must be dictated to him, so that he can live well.

Religion, as we know, was the most influential factor during medieval ages. Religion as the greatest fashion. History books have thought us that almost every village had its church and its priest preaching the Holy Tome, but; as many novelist wrote, people and even clerics often misinterpreted or manipulated the sacred teachings in one's favour. Clerics even had free choice regarding what to preach. In addition, rewriting secret books lead to undesired reinterpretations which were preserved over various historical periods.

Now imagine a village shaped by indoctrination through several generations. Many priests came bringing various creeds, different visions of the outside world, revealing to the poorest and most ignorant what was good, and what was evil, while the oldest villagers would share stories, sayings, myths and legends. This is a village that throughout its existence has been influenced mostly by the vision of a strictly religious man. Obviously the grafting of outsiders, required by the need for marriage, is not completely excluded. They brought diversity on a genetical and cultural level, but the foundations of ethics and morals laid by the clergyman and its religion were undethronable. The village I'm exposing as an example it works as a small aquarium, an artificial pond, a primordial broth.

It can be distinguished from other aquariums because this one has a priest who dwells very often on a certain religious parable, and the people of this aquarium behave in a certain way, due the events that have shaped their personalities. For example: the church bell came off while it was ringing noon, falling right on the widow's house. The village priest will say that God punished the widow for betraying her dead husband with the shepherd's twelfth son. In the nearby village the people, after listening their priest, will rather believe that it is the devil's fault. The farmers of the third village will blame the bell artisans who used a decrepit wax casting technique for the bell, and so on. What I'm trying to expose is that every single medieval village was microcosm, and the diversity between villages was palpable.

If we recontextualize this village in fantasy setting; the amplification of this phenomenon should be even greater. Usually in an "ideal" fantasy world a given land has been conquered by different nations, hoisting same or different religions. The villages and towns on that piece of land went through various metamorphoses, and with the sedimentation of time and traditions, the villages will tell their own story, diversified primarily by religion. That's why, when I play, I would like to see a Non-One-Dimentional setting, where the river village differs a lot from the one over the hill.


However, it's important to remember that some players may not be interested in exploring the complexities of religious and cultural diversity within an RPG setting.
Some players may be more interested in fast-paced action or other aspects of gameplay, and may not be as invested in the details of a village's religious beliefs or traditions. Additionally, some players may find it challenging to navigate complex and unfamiliar cultural contexts, particularly if they are not familiar with the historical or cultural references being used in the game. As such, it's important to strike a balance between creating a rich and detailed world and providing an accessible and engaging gameplay experience that appeals to a broad range of players. Where is the balance exactly? This shall be the topic of another article.
