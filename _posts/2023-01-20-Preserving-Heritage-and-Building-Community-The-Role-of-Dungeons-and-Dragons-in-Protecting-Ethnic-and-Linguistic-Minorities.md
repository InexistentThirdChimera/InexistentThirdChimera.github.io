Dungeons and Dragons, or D&D, is a role-playing game that has been enjoyed by millions of people around the world for decades. 

On the surface, Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) may appear to be a game of simple make-believe. However, the emotions, companionship, and accomplishments experienced in the game are real; suggesting that real-world needs are met through communication in socially constructed role-playing games scenarios. The notion that needs are met through RPGs is evidenced by the multitude of play-time hours accrued by groups as well as the ways that players bond, construct inside jokes, and revel in retelling specific adventures. Games such as D&D can be used as research sites to learn more about RPG players, small groups, and communication within social communities. Therefore, the goal of many studies is to explore the ways in which players fulfill social needs through group communication during the context of D&D.  The Bormann’s (1972) fantasy theme analysis is a method used to identify four themes which emerged within player talk: democratic ideologies, friendship 
maintenance; extraordinary experiences; and good versus evil.

Games have the potential to fulfill genuine human needs, engage learners, and unite people in unprecedented ways. Playtherapy games have been shown to teach children the self-concept, behavioral changes, cognitive abilities, social skills, and anxiety management. Fantasy games have been used to improve comprehension, spelling, and critical thinking for students with learning-disabilities. Research on digital games has shown that they contribute to higher levels of well-being, less depression, and less negative affect amongst older adults. On the whole, game-play may contribute to a variety of positive effects that researchers have only recently begun to understand. One specific game genre which may contribute to an assortment of cognitive health benefits is the RPG. RPGs allow players to become a character in a game by taking control of the character’s dialogue and actions. This can be a deeply personal process in which a player delves into the character’s psyche. When a player merges minds with a fictional character, the process can result in a significantly higher level of character attachment compared to other forms of character-driven media. Some of the cognitive benefits of RPGs include the ability to experience other perspectives, practice visualization, escape social pressure, increase personal control, improve social skills, and release unconscious fantasies. Many types of RPGS have been adapted to suit a variety of demographics and play-styles. For example, Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) RPGs (e.g., World of Warcraft), allow players to meet in virtual spaces via internet channels. Conversely, table-top RPGs (e.g., D&D, Pathfinder) typically require in-person group play. Regardless of the type, RPGs function as imaginary play-spaces that have the power to fulfill real-world needs.

Tugh D&D players as a group maintain a healthy psychological profile, personality traits are likely to differ between groups interested in any particular hobby to some extent. For example, fantasy RPG players report to be less feminine, less androgynous, have lower empathy, describe themselves as scientific, and engage in leisure activities such as reading and playing on computers.In contradiction to research which found that players did not differ on measures of extraversion, some research found players to be more introverted
than control groups. 

Essentially, research shows some ways that D&D players differ from the population average. As shown, players are more likely to feel estrangement and alienation. Therefore, it stands within reason to expect that RPG players may have different social needs which may not be fulfilled during everyday interactions; rather, these needs are achieved to some degree through fantasy game-play. In fact, D&D has been utilized as a therapeutic tool to help depressed patients meet similar social needs. As a location which allows individuals to practice important cognitive and social functions, D&D may effectively provide players with the opportunity to explore their mental dungeons and slay their psychic dragons. Therefore, D&D persists as an excellent site to explore how RPGs allow players to satisfy specific needs.

To summarize, the extant research demonstrates that game-play can provide numerous cognitive health benefits. In particular, RPGs may be well suited to fulfill genuine social needs. Yet, it is not the mere act of role-play which satisfies needs; rather, it is through the act of communication within the specific context of role-play that serves this function. Table-top fantasy RPGs are guided entirely by talk and interaction. As such, they have much potential to teach us about communication and the subsequent needs that are
met. D&D has persisted as an icon of RPG culture for nearly forty years, yet there has been little communication research in this area. Though research in communication has begun to study digital RPGs, table-top RPGs are typically referenced only during reports in which scholars trace the origin of MMOs. Instead, research on table-top gaming has primarily been conducted within psychology and anthropology.
Therefore, this study begins to fill a gap in the literature by utilizing D&D as a vehicle to explore communication. Through an analysis of fantasy themes, this study seeks to identify the ways in which players fulfill social needs through group communication during the context of D&D table-top role-play. The following research question guides this study: what fantasy themes emerged from D&D related RPG talk?

Communication via role-play in this group likely fulfilled a realworld need to enact democratic participation. Players were able to utilize inherent and unspoken democratic procedures to give their opinions, listen to others, and impact decisions. Research has shown that role-playing through imagined problems can teach democratic skills in small groups. A natural inclination toward democratic needs is not
an uncommon phenomenon; some consider democracy to be a universally shared value. Burke (1961) claims that democracy (particularly in Western culture) operates rhetorically as a god-term due to the fact that battles have been fought and lives have been lost in the pursuit of democratic ideologies. Relatedly, democracy can be classified as an ‘ultimate legitimizer’ meaning that due to its power and influence, it can be irrefutably accepted in specific cultures. Therefore, it was not surprising that democratic participation emerged as a chainedout fantasy theme evidenced in dialogue. Through participation in the D&D role-play community, members were able to engage in the pursuit of democratic practices.

The members of the D&D: Seeds community regularly practiced and valued principles of democracy. Though the DM could have acted as chief decision-maker, instead he maintained transparent communication and invited members to participate in planning processes. This was evidenced by administrative posts in which the DM solicited feedback, encouraged questions, reminded players of events, discussed rule changes, made announcements, and polled opinions. Two example quotes from the DM highlight this point: 


D&D's unique combination of storytelling, imagination, and collaboration creates a space where individuals from different backgrounds can come together and share their social and cultural heritage. This can be especially important for ethnic and linguistic minorities, who may face challenges in preserving their culture and language in a dominant society. For example, D&D can be used as a tool for language preservation among indigenous communities. Through the game, players can learn and practice traditional words and phrases in their native language, as well as learn about their culture's history and customs. This can help to strengthen their connection to their heritage and pass it down to future generations.

In addition, D&D can also be used to promote cultural understanding and acceptance among different ethnic and linguistic groups. 
Through the game, players can learn and practice traditional words and phrases in their native language, as well as learn about their culture's history and customs. Players from different backgrounds come together and learn about each other's culture and language, fostering mutual respect and understanding. This can be especially important in societies where diversity is not always celebrated or where certain groups face discrimination.

Furthermore, D&D also fosters teamwork and cooperation which are important skills that can help individuals in their personal and professional lives. This helps in building a better relationship with people of other cultures, which is a vital aspect of preserving the culture.

In conclusion, Dungeons and Dragons is more than just a game. It is a powerful social instrument that can help preserve the culture and language of ethnic and linguistic minorities. It provides a space for individuals to come together, share their heritage, and learn about each other's culture, promoting mutual understanding and acceptance. Furthermore, it also helps in building teamwork and cooperation, which are important skills in personal and professional lives. This can be a very valuable tool for building a more inclusive and harmonious society.
