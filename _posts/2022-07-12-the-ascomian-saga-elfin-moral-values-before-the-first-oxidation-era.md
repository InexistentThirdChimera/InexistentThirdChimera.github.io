       “Why should I do what I’m supposed morally to do. Have I any reason to constrain the pursue of my own interests in recognition of interest of my own people? Morality is truly a grotesque construction.” - words spoken by an Elf

Due to a lifestyle based on solitary pilgrimages and occasional meetings during the Tree Feasts, the Elfin community was a society which has to be formed and constantly reformed out of nothing. The social values acquired by meanings of travel and combat, which one has brought with to the meetings, would be applied without scrutiny to this very mutable and constantly disintegrating situation. 
Moreover, the moral values of the Ascomian world were there because humans put them there. To speak more precisely: it was a mistake to think of the human language of moral values as if it was describing some features of the natural world outside their society. Conditions of great stress and deprivation are not the right conditions for observing the typical behavior of any beast, nor for observing characteristics of human beings. Consequently: the moral language of humans was not descriptive but expressive. Obviously the act of composing this moral language was felt as a liberation, and perceived as the coronation of the unlimited human imagination. 
An amoral language, on the other hand, was not constrained by the world and the necessity of expression. The amoral values of the Elves are descriptive: they describe the nature of Ascom as it was before the First Oxidation and the human ascension. It’s now clear that Humans will always define Elves as amoral because the Elfin morality was discovered, not chosen -artificial. 

Elves understood this concepts, given that they’ve been contemplating them for a long time. It’s often felt by the Elves, even if obscurely, that there is an element of deception in men-made morality, because a view on morality will eventually shake thoughts and ideas, causing contamination of objectiveness by emotions. Elfin morality cannot be subjective in a way where it likes and dislikes. The separation of descriptions from attitudes, or the separation of facts from values, that characterize the human moral language, is by moral meanings: bad. 

Life was important to them, yet meaningless: an inconsolable desire for knowledge, twisted speculations and extreme experiments, designed to unveil the secrets of life, erased the borders of ethic by signing a warrant of the death of self-consciousness. Everything was allowed. 

“In the end we all have to choose for ourselves and no one can do it for anyone else.” - words spoken by and Elf

Amoralism does not imply irrationality. Elves are in fact very rational beasts and will act or react only when the reasons to do so are grounded it Elf’s own interests.
A moral human that acts through moral teachings cannot be indifferent to matters such as suffering and injustice, he will not, however, take the fact that ought to have certain ends as in itself reason to adopt them. An amoral Elf however, may deny that he has any reason to trouble his head over this or any other moral demand.  
To an amoralist moral virtues can have its rewards but an amoralist can’t think of virtue as it own reward, nor can the amoralist be given reason to distinguish real virtue from a convincing doppelganger. 

Elves will obviously praise those who possess great knowledge in order to steal or barter their secrets. They will eventually speak highly of the practitioners of the five arts, but only if exceptionally skilled. Free thinkers may also be intriguing subjects for Elves, while religious fanatics, spokesmen of morals and political opinions, liars and scoundrels, will certainly be avoided or harmed.
